# Hi, my name is Johannes

I am studying Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich

My main areas of study are Machine Learning and Computer Vision

## Check out some of the projects I've previosuly worked on

### [Point-Set Alignment Using Weak Labels](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp)

You may want to see our [project report](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp/blob/main/Project_Report.pdf) and [supplementary material](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp/blob/main/Supplementary_Materials.pdf)

### [Search-Based Robustness Testing for traffic sign classifiers](https://gitfront.io/r/JohannesVolk/kGpYddba232z/traffic-sign-classifier-robustness-testing/)

In this project, we evaluated several algorithms for their performance in finding minimal "sticker attacks" against Deep Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Classification
