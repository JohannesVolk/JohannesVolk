# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Johannes

I am a postgraduate studying Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich and Data Science at the University of Queensland.

## Check out some of the stuff I've previously worked on


### [A Framework for Analysing Delays within Public Transport Networks](https://github.com/JohannesVolk/data7001-project)

We propose a framework to analyze the live compared to the historical network delay in public transport systems.

You may want to see our [project report](https://github.com/JohannesVolk/data7001-project/blob/main/report.pdf).

### [Point-Set Alignment Using Weak Labels](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp)

You may want to see our [project report](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp/blob/main/Project_Report.pdf) and [supplementary material](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp/blob/main/Supplementary_Materials.pdf)

In this course project we used the DL-based Point Set Registration Method Deep Closest Point (DCP) to detect heads/faces in 3D Operation Room scenes. We assembled a new dataset to synthetically train our model, which ultimately performed slightly better on the synthetic data than non-DL-based methods such as FilterReg.

### [Search-Based Robustness Testing for traffic sign classifiers](https://gitfront.io/r/JohannesVolk/kGpYddba232z/traffic-sign-classifier-robustness-testing/)

Take a look at a excempt of our [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pT7yqmQ0gV0R_XKGlxi67L1DDFZcRNim/view?usp=share_link).

In this project, we evaluated several algorithms for their performance in finding minimal "sticker attacks" against Deep Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Classification. For instance, we used Genetic Search, (Un-)/informed Search, Metaheuristic Search, Brute-Force Search. We compared [JMetalPy](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetalPy) and [Pymoo](https://pymoo.org/), two major optimization frameworks implemented in Python. We also explored more complex problems like multi sticker attacks and gradient-based search strategies.

The following visualizes the energy of the search space according to a simple fitness function considering uncertainty in the prediction of the traffic sign's label.
One can clearly notice the gradient leading to the area of greatest performance loss when attacked.

Below is the search progression of a genetic algorithm that manages to converge to the optimal minimum discovered by exhaustive search.
