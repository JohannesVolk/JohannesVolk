# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Johannes

I am studying Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich. My main areas of study are Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I was nominated by TUM to do an international double degree in cooperation with the M.Sc. Data Science at the University of Queensland in Australia from 2024.

## Check out some of the projects I've previously worked on

### [Point-Set Alignment Using Weak Labels](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp)

You may want to see our [project report](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp/blob/main/Project_Report.pdf) and [supplementary material](https://github.com/wngTn/synthetic_dcp/blob/main/Supplementary_Materials.pdf)

### [Search-Based Robustness Testing for traffic sign classifiers](https://gitfront.io/r/JohannesVolk/kGpYddba232z/traffic-sign-classifier-robustness-testing/)

Take a look at a excempt of our [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pT7yqmQ0gV0R_XKGlxi67L1DDFZcRNim/view?usp=share_link).

In this project, we evaluated several algorithms for their performance in finding minimal "sticker attacks" against Deep Neural Networks for Traffic Sign Classification. For instance, we used Genetic Search, (Un-)/informed Search, Metaheuristic Search, Brute-Force Search. We compared [JMetalPy](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetalPy) and [Pymoo](https://pymoo.org/), two major optimization frameworks implemented in Python. We also explored more complex problems like multi sticker attacks and gradient-based search strategies.

The following visualizes the energy of the search space according to a simple fitness function considering uncertainty in the prediction of the traffic sign's label.
One can clearly notice the gradient leading to the area of greatest performance loss when attacked.

Below is the search progression of a genetic algorithm that manages to converge to the optimal minimum discovered by exhaustive search.
